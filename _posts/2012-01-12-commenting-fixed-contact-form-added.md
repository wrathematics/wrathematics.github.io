Commenting here was effectively (accidentally) disabled for probably a
few weeks due to some overzealous anti-spam policy that resulted from
getting inundated with hundreds of spam posts in just a few days.  The
issue has been corrected.  Additionally, I have added a contact form on
my [About](http://librestats.com/about/ "About") page.

Feel free to use these to contact me and tell me what a dumb person I
am.
