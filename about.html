<p>
I am an open source software developer largely interested in the 
intersection of mathematics, statistics, and high performance
computing.
</p>

<p>
My formal background is mathematics, with some sprinkling of
statistics.  But these days I mostly look like a computer scientist.
I know a great deal about the inner cobwebs of the R language, and 
mostly spend my time linking it to high performance C and Fortran code.
</p>

<p>
Currently, I am founding member and co-lead developer of the 
<a href="http://r-pbd.org">pbdR project</a>, 
which elevates the R programming language to supercomputers.
