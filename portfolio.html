Below are some selected projects for which I have a lead authorship.
Things to which I have merely contributed to are not listed.

<h1>R packages</h1>


<h3>Utilities</h3>

<p>
<a href="https://github.com/wrathematics/memuse">
memuse</a>:
A package for benchmarkers.  Estimates the memory usage of matrices
and other objects.  Contains numerous other convenience utilities,
including those for gathering hardware RAM, swap, and cache
information.
</p>

<p>
<a href="https://github.com/Rth-org">
Rth</a>:
Multicore programming in R through thrust
</p>

<p>
<a href="https://github.com/wrathematics/RNACI">
RNACI</a>:
A collection of utilities that make dealing with R's native C
interface more manageable.  Notably the package handles
simplified SEXP allocation (with automatic gc counting), and 
the creation and management of lists and dataframes.
For instance, by making use of C99's va_args, we can create 
arbitrary lists of named objects in just 2 simple function calls.
</p>

<p>
<a href="https://github.com/wrathematics/yalda">
yalda</a>:
"Yet Another LDA" package.  Wraps the serial portion of the Google
plda program for use with R.
</p>

<p>
<a href="https://github.com/wrathematics/cpuid">
cpuid</a>:
R package that gives some basic cpu information (clock speed, 
number of cores, etc.).
</p>

<p>
<a href="https://github.com/wrathematics/rgutenberg">
rgutenberg</a>:
A resource for those who need quick access to some sample text
corpora.  Just as R's rnorm() can be used to generate
"fake" numerical data, the rgutenverg package's 
rgutenberg() samples a random book from Project
Gutenberg.  The package also includes numerous texts as easily
accessed, already preprocessed datasets.
</p>

<p>
<a href="https://github.com/wrathematics/f2cp">
f2cp</a>:
A set of parsers to scan Fortran source files and generate 
C prototypes.  
</p>

<h3>Just for Fun</h3>

<p>
<a href="https://github.com/wrathematics/Rfiglet">
Rfiglet</a>:
R bindings for figlet.  Creates ascii logos.
</p>

<p>
<a href="https://github.com/wrathematics/xkcdpw">
xkcdpw</a>:
A package for making portmanteau-style passwords, as in 
<a href="https://xkcd.com/936/">this famous XKCD comic</a>.
Words are taken from scrapings of random Wikipedia pages.
</p>

<p>
<a href="https://github.com/wrathematics/tfca">
tfca</a>:
Some methods for computing transfinite cardinal arithmetic.
</p>

<p>
<a href="https://github.com/wrathematics/gmhelper">
gmhelper</a>:
A collection of utilities for game masters of fantasy-based
role playing games, with a GUI and everything!
</p>

<p>
<a href="https://github.com/wrathematics/idgaf">
idgaf</a>:
All public GitHub commits containing the word "fuck" in the commit
message, from 3/11/2012 to 7/24/2014.
</p>
